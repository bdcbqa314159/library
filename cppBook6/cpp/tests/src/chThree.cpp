    ************************************************************************
    KISS:
    Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
    Keep IT Simple, Stupid.
    ************************************************************************
    YAGNI:
    Always implemement things when you actually need them, never when you just foress that you need them.
    You Ain't Gonna Need It!
    ************************************************************************
    DRY:
    Copy and paste is a design error.
    Don't Repeat Yourself.
    ************************************************************************
    Information Hiding
    Which is not Encapsulation.
    It is the basic principle for decomposing systems into modules.
    Pros:
        Limitation of the consequences of changes in modules.
        Minimal influence on other modules if a bug fix is necessary.
        Significantly increasing the reusability of modules.
        Better testability of modules.
    The vlient code does not depend on internal parts of the class anymore.
    ************************************************************************
    Strong Cohesion
    Very close to single responsibility principle it helps to higher cohesion
    avoid too many dependencies.
    ************************************************************************
    Loose Coupling
    The dependencies have to be with interfaces rather than concrete classes
    -> Abstract classes.
    ************************************************************************
    Be Careful with Optimizations
    Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it)
    in programming.
    ************************************************************************
    Principle of Leadt Astonishment (PLA)
    User should not be surprised by unexpected responses of the user interface.
    ************************************************************************
    The Boy Scout Rule
    Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
